# Dungeon-Dweller

Game I made with a friend in high school senior year for a coding class.

Play the game here: https://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/28303

Help the green slime escape the castle dungeons and back to the forest.




NOTE: Don't worry there are instructions in the game (I learned from Ponyu) 


___HOW TO RUN___
You need to install Greenfoot if you want to mess with code. Otherwise, click on the link to play in browser.
