# Dungeon-Dweller

Game I made with a friend in high school senior year for a coding class.

Play the game here: https://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/28303

__HOW TO RUN___
You need to install Greenfoot if you want to mess with code.

___LORE (in case you ever wanted to know)___
- Ponyu, the titular blue slime, infiltrates a Taco Bell one night to get some Cinnabons. 
- Suddenly, he discovers a trap door in the kitchen and decides to investigate. 
- What secrets will Ponyu find in this Taco Bell?

__GAMEPLAY (because there are no instructions)__
1. Move with WASD
2. Shoot slime balls with SPACE
3. Get 100 Cinnabons (aka hit the Craneo Fuegos 100 times)
4. If you get hit, you lose some Cinnabons but it's okay because you don't have lives
5. If you die and are floating in mid-air, just hit D to go down back to the "floor"
